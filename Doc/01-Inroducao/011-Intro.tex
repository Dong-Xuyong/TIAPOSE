Throughout this document we will first analyze the beverage sales data, then we will apply forecasting techniques to predict the number of sales of each beverage, this forecast will be divided by a univariate forecast and a multivariate forecast, for both will be used the knowledge and practices acquired in class to predict successfully. Finally, we have Optimization, which consists of finding the best values in order to maximize the sales value of each drink.
