\subsection{The Work Methodology and Auto-Evaluation}
\quad For the Group Auto-Evaluation we think that we deserve {\bfseries 16} for our project final grade. We think that we deserved this grade because we where able to complete the tasks:\\

\quad \textbullet Dataset description;

\quad \textbullet Univariate prediction using train-test split;

\quad \textbullet Univariate prediction using Growing and Rowling window split;

\quad \textbullet Multivariate prediction;

\quad \textbullet Otimization of transport;

\quad \textbullet Interface.\\

And there where no tasks that we could not completed, although we believe that we could do a better job with the interface.\\

For the Individual Auto-Evaluation our group thinks this the grade that each element of the group deserves:
