\section{Previs√£o}

\quad Now that we have a good idea of the problem in questian and all the data related to that problem, now we shall start to use Machine Lerning techniques to predict the values of the next day using all the data from the data in the excel file. 

There are two way we can predict the values, using only one set of values, Univariate Search, or we can use more than one set of values, Multivariate Search. In this section of the document we will demonstrate the techniques used to predict and the respective results.
